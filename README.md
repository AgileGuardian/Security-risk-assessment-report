# Security-risk-assessment-report

## Objectives of the Assessment Report

The main objectives of this cybersecurity assessment report are to:

1. **Identify and Address Vulnerabilities**: Highlight the critical vulnerabilities in the organization's network and propose effective hardening tools and methods to mitigate these risks.
2. **Enhance Network Security**: Implement measures that strengthen the overall security posture of the organization, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
3. **Prevent Unauthorized Access and Attacks**: Propose solutions that specifically prevent brute force attacks, password sharing, and other unauthorized access attempts by enforcing stronger security practices.

## Skills Learned by the Cybersecurity Analyst

During this assessment, the cybersecurity analyst developed and applied several key skills:

1. **Vulnerability Identification**: Analyzing network configurations and security practices to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
2. **Implementation of Security Controls**: Recommending and understanding the implementation of security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and regular firewall maintenance.
3. **Incident Response Planning**: Learning to anticipate and plan for potential security incidents, including refining firewall rules and access controls to respond effectively to security threats.
4. **Policy Development**: Crafting comprehensive security policies that enforce best practices in password management and authentication, contributing to a more secure network environment.

## Tools Used

The cybersecurity analyst utilized various tools and frameworks to conduct the assessment and make recommendations:

1. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: A framework that provides guidelines for managing and reducing cybersecurity risks, helping to identify and prioritize actions to protect the organization.
2. **OWASP Top Ten**: A resource that lists the most critical web application security risks, used to assess and improve the security posture of web applications and identify common vulnerabilities.
3. **CIS Controls**: A set of best practices developed by the Center for Internet Security, used to guide the implementation of security measures such as multi-factor authentication, password policies, and firewall management.
